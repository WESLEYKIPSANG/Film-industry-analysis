DATA ANALYSIS FOR FILM INDUSTRY ENTRY 
This project analyzes various film industry datasets to uncover trends that can guide a company's 
strategic entry into the entertainment industry. As major corporations turn to original content creation, 
our company aims to establish a successful movie studio. However, due to limited experience in film 
production, the business needs insight-driven guidance. This analysis will highlight the most profitable, 
well-received, and promising areas in film today. 
By integrating multiple datasets we aim to explore current industry patterns to provide actionable 
recommendations on the types of films the new studio should prioritize. 
Business Understanding 
With streaming platforms, digital distribution evolving, film production has become both an art and a 
high-stakes business. 
This analysis will help answer the following key business questions: 
• What genres offer the highest return on investment(ROI)? 
• Which film with low budgets gives more returns? 
• Which studio produce the highest revenue? 
Datasets 
This project draws on a robust combination of industry datasets: 
• Box Office Mojo: Gross earning and box office performance 
• The MovieDB: Metadata on movies include genres , languages, production countries,popularity 
and more. 
• The Numbers : Financial details such as production budgets and revenues to help calculate ROI.   
Together, these datasets offer a comprehensive view of the global film landscape. 
Methodology: Collaboration  Approach to Film Data Analysis 
Data Exploration 
• This phase focuses on understanding the dataset, identifying important columns, and 
investigating potential relationships that could be explored. 
• I assess the structure of the data, determine which columns are crucial for our analysis, and 
evaluate whether the data is clean or requires attention. 
• I investigates different subsets of the data to understand the distribution, data types, and to 
identify any obvious issues (e.g., missing values, inconsistencies). 
• The goal is to identify any initial patterns, issues, or opportunities for further exploration and to 
form hypotheses that guide the next steps in the analysis. 
Data Preparation & Cleaning 
• After initial exploration, I focus on preparing the data for further analysis by accurately merging 
various datasets, ensuring that relationships are explored correctly. 
• I handle any missing values through imputations, and perform other cleaning tasks (e.g., 
removing duplicates, handling inconsistencies). 
• The data is structured in a way that allows me to explore relationships in greater depth and 
ensures that the datasets are accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. 
• This stage ensures that the data is in a clean, usable state for modeling and deeper insights. 
Data Analysis 
• Here I explore visual trends related to genres , budget category and ROI which I used  
histograms for data visualizations . 
Business Recommendations 
• Synthesizing results into clear, actionable insights for the new movie studio. 
• Focused on helping decision-makers prioritize genres, directors, languages, and film types 
based              
on profitability, audience reception, and global appeal. 
Limitations of Our Analysis 
• Discusses the limitations of the analysis, such as potential biases in the dataset, missing 
information, and sampling constraints. 
• Acknowledges areas where further exploration, data collection, or improved methods could
